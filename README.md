# Labyrinthium
## Three Dimensional Randomly Generated Maze Game Implemented In Python

---

### Current Progress:
+ Need to create a user interface w/ python libraries to simulate the maze

### In Process Goals:
* Basic Implementation [text & algorithms] - Done
* General UI [Using a precreated python lib]
* Base UI [Our Own Created Game Graphics]
* Final UI [Good Graphics, Sleek User Interface, and Extra Additional Setup]

## `CURRENT`Game Logic:
#### Movement Dimensions Figure:
| Move          |Direction Val | Ploarity |
| :------------- |:------------:| :--------:|
| `forward`      | 0            | 1        |
| `backward`     | 0            | 0        | 
| `up`           | 1            | 1        | 
| `down`         | 1            | 0        | 
| `left`         | 2            | 1        | 
| `right`         | 2            | 0        | 

#### Text Controlled Game:
+ User information and Defaults are set
+ Map Is randomly chosen and generated based on a given size w/ cases included
+ User must input movement directions in the correct pattern to reach the end of the game
+ Basic Prompting so Far
