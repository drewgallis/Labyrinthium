# Labyrinthium
## Three Dimensional Randomly Generated Maze Game Implemented In Python

### Current Progress:
+ Need to create a user interface w/ python libraries to simulate the maze

### In Process Goals:
* Basic Implementation [text & algorithms] - Done
* General UI [Using a precreated python lib]
* Base UI [Our Own Created Game Graphics]
* Final UI [Good Graphics, Sleek User Interface, and Extra Additional Setup]

#### Movement Dimensions:
* Forward [0,1]
* Backward [0,0]
* Up [1,1]
* Down [1,0]
* Left [2,1]
* Right [2,0]

#### Text Controlled Game:
+ User information and Defaults are set
+ Map Is randomly chosen and generated based on a given size w/ cases included
+ User must input movement directions in the correct pattern to reach the end of the game
+ Basic Prompting so Far
